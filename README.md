Preview Included

The scope of this projects is to show the data of the soccer teams from England which play in a league called English Premier League. The league comprises of 20 teams play against each other season of which one crowned champion of that season. Also, each season bottom three teams are eliminated and new three teams come into the league. Every team plays a total of 38 matches in one season. 17 in their home stadium and 17 in the away (every opponent’s) stadium. For every match won the team gets 3 points and for a draw result both the teams get 1 point each. At the end of the season the team with the most points win the league that season.
A decision support system of this sort will help managers analyze their team’s performance to have an upper hand in the upcoming matches or to understand how their team compares to the other teams in the league. There is also a system that calculates the probability of any team’s winning percent any given year. 

The System.xlsm will not work as it is uploaded only to show the code which can be accessed from the developer tab.

The following is a short clip of the whole system.
